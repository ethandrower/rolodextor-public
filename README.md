# Contact management - based off of angular seed app

This is a fairly primitive implementation of a contact manager using Parse-Server as a backend.

Add your contacts, and set intervals to remind you to reach out and maintain the relationship.

This will be cleaned up, documented and hosted somewhere for general use, but i wanted to get the code up publicly as a starting point.

Any questions feel free to email me @ the address in my profile.  Cheers!
